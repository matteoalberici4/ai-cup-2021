# Artificial Intelligence Cup 2021
This is my solution for the competition of the Artificial Intelligence course @ USI - Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana: the AI CUP 2021. <br>
The competition goal is to implement some algorithms in order to find the shortest tours in a collection of TSP problems. All the algorithms I implemented or tried to implement were learned during the lectures of professor Luca Maria Gambardella and during the tutorials of the teaching assistant Umberto Junior Mele.

In order to execute the solver, type:
* Compiling option 1: *c++ main.cpp -o main*
* Compiling option 2: *make main*

Finally, run the executable file as follows: *./main*
